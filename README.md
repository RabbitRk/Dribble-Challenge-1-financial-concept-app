# Financial concept app from Dribbble

## Design Challenge 1.

This project is a personal skill development on converting a design into the pixel perfect Flutter apps. For this shot I have designed atmost every designs. Searching for icons and svg's are really painfull. So I just skipped those and concentrate on layout building and animations. Other features like bottom navigation and its animations will be fulfilled in the future.
